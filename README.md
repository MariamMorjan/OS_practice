# OS_practice

This is repo contains some of the exercises in the textbook Operating System Concepts, Ninth Edition. You could find more about the book in [here](http://www.os-book.com/).

Feel free to raise an issue or start pull request for my code. Apparently, my implementations are not the perfect ones, but they will usually work and meet the requirement in the exercise description.
